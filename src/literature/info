- very relavent to hexagonal calculations. It does them for configurations with as many as 28 magnets, 
	but focuses on configurations where "onions" of rings have a lower energy than a single ring - which only happens
	starting at N=18.

Magnetic Interactions in 2D and 3D arrays

- pages of interest : 91-103
- a PhD thesis
- looks at the spin configurations in a number of structures with 2-4 magnetised spheres
